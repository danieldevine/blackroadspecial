#Blackroadspecial
This is just the Wordpress Theme that powers [www.blackroad.ie](http://blackroad.ie)

##Disclaimer
This theme is in development, with a very long TODO list.
Not to be installed on a real live site by actual live humans, or bad, bad things will almost certainly happen.

##Build
Build with Grunt and Sass.

##Forms
This theme features a simple, built-in contact form that is summoned by hitting a big button on the visual editor.

##Plug-ins
I'm trying to operate this with as few plug-ins as possible, inevitably the live site will need Yoast or similar to apease the SEO monsters. Current plug-in dependencies: 0

##Featuring
This theme makes use of the [Responsive Grid System](https://github.com/grahammiller/ResponsiveGridSystem) by Graham Miller. We have [Prism.js](http://lea.verou.me) by Lea Verou, [Liquid Slider 2](http://liquidslider.com) by Kevin Batdorf and [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy is in there too.

##Licence
Released under GPL v3.0
