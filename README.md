#Blackroadspecial
This is just the Wordpress Theme that powers www.blackroad.ie

##Build
Build with Grunt and Sass.
I use Typekit for the font so only weights are declared in the (S)CSS.

##Credit
This theme makes use of the Responsive Grid System invented by Graham Miller.
As of version 1.0 this theme uses no JavaScript (natively)...not sure how this happened and its not political. Expect js in future versions.

##Disclaimer
CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, long TODO list.
This is not intended or recommended for use in client websites as a lot of the content is meshed with the theme in a way that wouldn't be practical for a client to maintain but is easier for me. I doubt this will be of much use to anyone else in its entirety. You might like parts of it, which you are free to rip out and use as you choose.

##Licence
Released under GPL v3.0
