#Blackroadspecial
This is just the Wordpress Theme that (will) power [www.blackroad.ie](http://blackroad.ie)
in the near future.

##Build
Build with Grunt and Sass.
I use Typekit for the font so only weights are declared in the (s)css.

##Credit
This theme makes use of the [Responsive Grid System](https://github.com/grahammiller/ResponsiveGridSystem) invented by Graham Miller.
As of version 1.0 this theme uses no JavaScript (natively)...not sure how this happened and its not political :) . Expect js in future versions.

##Forms
This theme features a bog-simple, built in contact form that is summoned by hitting a big button on the visual editor.

##Disclaimer
this theme is in development, with a very long TODO list.
The plan in the short term is to neutralize it into a nice simple starter theme.
This is not intended or recommended for use on client websites as a lot of the content is meshed with the theme in a way that wouldn't be practical for a client to maintain (but is easier for me).

##Licence
Released under GPL v3.0
