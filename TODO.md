#To Do
  1. Add font face fonts
  2. Widgetize footer area / use some other means of despecifying the content because I don't like widgets very much.
  3. Responsive headlines.
  4. Hard-wire some form capabilities (or look into requiring some plug ins)
  5. Styling and layout for custom post types.
  6. Start using <code>wp_nav_menu</code> while maintaining the central logo idea.
  7. Responsive images.
